I love math and using it to understand the motion of fluids. I did my undergraduate at UC Berkeley in applied mathematics with a goal to use that math for physical oceanography. Outside of academics I love eating food, cooking, and baking. Favorite dish has always been okonomiyaki　お好み焼き, a Japanese savory pancake whose ingredients are very loosely defined (hence okonomi お好み, "whatever you like"). In my patissier career have gotten my macarons to a decent level.
