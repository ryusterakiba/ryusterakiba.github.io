# <center>Ocean Worlds</center>

<p align="justify">

There exist oceans outside of Earth in our solar system within icy moons. These oceans, for 
example inside Europa or Enceladus, are exciting places to look for habitable environments for extraterrestrial life. Much remains unknown about these oceans, such as the thickness of the overlying ice shell, the properties of the salty ocean, and what processes are occuring at the seafloor. It is an exciting time to be looking at Ocean Worlds, as NASA's Europa Clipper and ESA's JUICE missions are expected to launch soon.

<p align='justify'> 

I am interested in the internal structure of these icy moons and what can be detected by future missions. Measurements of gravity and topography can be combined with models of the ice shell to tease out some of its properties. The ice shell is complex; its base is a phase boundary between solid ice and salty liquid water, it is being heated by tidal dissipation, and heat may be transported by conduction and/or convection.
