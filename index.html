<center> About me</center> 

<p align="justify">

I'm a PhD student at the University of California, Santa Cruz in the Earth and Planetary Sciences department. I recently completed my undergraduate degree in Applied Mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley. My undergrad research focused on modeling the internal structure of the icy moons of Jupiter and Saturn, which are thought to harbor subsurface liquid water oceans. In my PhD, I am interested in working on Ocean Worlds at the intersection of oceanography and planetary science, applying models of the Earth's oceans and seafloor to help make predictions about extraterrestrial oceans, for example in Jupiterâ€™s moon Europa.
